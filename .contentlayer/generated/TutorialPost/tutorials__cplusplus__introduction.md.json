The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.\n\n### Core Features:\n- **Object-Oriented**: C++ introduces classes and objects, allowing for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n- **Performance**: Like C, it allows for low-level memory manipulation, making it extremely fast and efficient. This is why it's a popular choice for game engines, high-frequency trading, and embedded systems.\n- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: A set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc.\n- **Scalability**: C++ can be used to create large-scale applications with complex requirements.\n- **Compatibility with C**: C++ is highly compatible with C, allowing C code to be easily included in C++ programs.\n\nC++ is a versatile language used in a wide range of applications, from operating systems and browsers to graphical user interfaces and game development.",
