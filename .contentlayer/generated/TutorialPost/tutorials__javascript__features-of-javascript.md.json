It's a high-level, interpreted language that is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.\n\nJavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, which includes several features when it comes to web development. Some of the features are lightweight, dynamic, functional, and interpreted.\n\nLet's discuss some important features of JavaScript:\n\n1.  **Lightweight Scripting Language**: JavaScript is lightweight because it is designed for client-side execution in the browser. This makes it fast and efficient for enhancing user interfaces.\n2.  **Dynamic Typing**: Variables in JavaScript are not tied to a specific type. You can reassign variables to different types at any time.\n3.  **Functional Style**: JavaScript supports functional programming paradigms, treating functions as first-class citizens. You can pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and assign them to variables.\n4.  **Platform Independent**: JavaScript can run on any platform with a web browser, be it Windows, macOS, or Linux.\n5.  **Prototype-based Language**: JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance instead of classes (though ES6 introduced class syntax as syntactic sugar over prototypes).\n6.  **Interpreted Language**: JavaScript code is interpreted line-by-line by the browser's engine, which means you don't need a compilation step.\n7.  **Single-Threaded**: JavaScript has a single-threaded execution model, which means it processes one task at a time. Asynchronous operations are handled by the event loop.\n8.  **Async Processing**: With features like Promises and async/await, JavaScript can handle asynchronous operations like API calls without blocking the main thread.\n9.  **Web Workers**: Allows for running scripts in background threads, enabling long-running tasks without freezing the UI.\n10. **Client-side Validation**: JavaScript is widely used to validate user input on the client-side before sending data to the server.\n11. **Backend Development**: With Node.js, JavaScript can be used to build full-stack applications.\n12. **More Control in Browser**: JavaScript gives developers extensive control over the browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).\n",
