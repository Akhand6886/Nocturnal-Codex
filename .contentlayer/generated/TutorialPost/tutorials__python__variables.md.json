Python has no command for declaring a variable; a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.\n\n```python\nx = 5       # x is of type int\ny = \"Hello\" # y is of type str\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\n```\n\n### Naming Variables\n\n- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n- A variable name cannot start with a number.\n- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).\n\nThis tutorial covers Python variables in more detail.\n",
