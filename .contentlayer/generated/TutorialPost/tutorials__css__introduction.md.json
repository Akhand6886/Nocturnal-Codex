CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. It allows web developers to control the look and feel of a website, including colors, fonts, layout, and responsive design.\n\n### The \"Cascading\" in CSS\n\nThe \"cascading\" part refers to the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule conflicts for a particular element. This system is a fundamental aspect of CSS. The cascade order is generally:\n1.  **Inline styles**: Styles applied directly to an HTML element (e.g., `<p style=\"color: red;\">`).\n2.  **ID selectors**: Rules that target an element with a specific ID (e.g., `#my-id`).\n3.  **Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes**: Rules that target elements by class, attribute, or state (e.g., `.my-class`, `[type=\"text\"]`, `:hover`).\n4.  **Type selectors and pseudo-elements**: Rules that target element types (e.g., `p`, `div`, `::before`).\n\n### Why use CSS?\n\n- **Separation of Concerns**: It separates the document content (HTML) from its presentation, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n- **Consistency**: You can define a style once and apply it to multiple pages.\n- **Accessibility**: Correctly used, CSS can improve the accessibility of a website.\n- **Responsive Design**: With features like media queries, CSS allows you to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.\n\nWithout CSS, all web pages would be plain text on a white background. It is an essential skill for any front-end web developer.",
