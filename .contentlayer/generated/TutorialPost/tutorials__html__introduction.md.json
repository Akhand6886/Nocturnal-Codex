It forms the very skeleton of web pages. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and scripting languages such as JavaScript for functionality.\n\n### Core Concepts\n\n- **Elements**: HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.\n- **Tags**: The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, a simple paragraph is enclosed in `<p>` tags: `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`.\n- **Attributes**: Tags can also have attributes, which provide additional information about an element. For example, an `<img>` tag has a `src` attribute to specify the image source: `<img src=\"image.jpg\">`.\n\n### Basic Document Structure\n\nA typical HTML document has the following structure:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Page Title</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>\n    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares that this document is an HTML5 document.\n- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.\n- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as its title.\n- `<body>`: Contains the visible page content.\n\nHTML is the foundational technology that every web developer must know.",
