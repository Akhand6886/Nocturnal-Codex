Python has no command for declaring a variable; a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.\n\n```python\nx = 5       # x is of type int\ny = \"Hello\" # y is of type str\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\n```\n\n### Naming Variables\n\n- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n- A variable name cannot start with a number.\n- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).\n\n## Data Types\n\nPython has various built-in data types. Here are some fundamental ones:\n\n- **Text Type**: `str`\n- **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float`, `complex`\n- **Sequence Types**: `list`, `tuple`, `range`\n- **Mapping Type**: `dict`\n- **Set Types**: `set`, `frozenset`\n- **Boolean Type**: `bool`\n- **Binary Types**: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`\n\n### Example of Data Types\n\n```python\nmy_string = \"Python is fun\"      # str\nmy_integer = 100                 # int\nmy_float = 3.14                  # float\nmy_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]    # list\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30} # dict\nmy_boolean = True                # bool\n\nprint(type(my_string))\nprint(type(my_integer))\nprint(type(my_float))\n```\n\nUnderstanding variables and data types is crucial for writing any Python program.\n",
