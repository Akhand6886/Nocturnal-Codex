JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for building interactive and dynamic websites.\n\nJavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, which includes several features when it comes to web development. Some of the features are lightweight, dynamic, functional, and interpreted.\n\nLet's discuss some important features of JavaScript:\n\n1.  **Lightweight Scripting Language**: JavaScript is lightweight because it is designed for client-side execution in the browser. This makes it fast and efficient for enhancing user interfaces.\n2.  **Dynamic Typing**: Variables in JavaScript are not tied to a specific type. You can reassign variables to different types at any time.\n3.  **Functional Style**: JavaScript supports functional programming paradigms, treating functions as first-class citizens. You can pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, and assign them to variables.\n4.  **Platform Independent**: JavaScript can run on any platform with a web browser, be it Windows, macOS, or Linux.\n5.  **Prototype-based Language**: JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance instead of classes (though ES6 introduced class syntax as syntactic sugar over prototypes).\n6.  **Interpreted Language**: JavaScript code is interpreted line-by-line by the browser's engine, which means you don't need a compilation step.\n7.  **Single-Threaded**: JavaScript has a single-threaded execution model, which means it processes one task at a time. Asynchronous operations are handled by the event loop.\n8.  **Async Processing**: With features like Promises and async/await, JavaScript can handle asynchronous operations like API calls without blocking the main thread.\n9.  **Web Workers**: Allows for running scripts in background threads, enabling long-running tasks without freezing the UI.\n10. **Client-side Validation**: JavaScript is widely used to validate user input on the client-side before sending data to the server.\n11. **Backend Development**: With Node.js, JavaScript can be used to build full-stack applications.\n12. **More Control in Browser**: JavaScript gives developers extensive control over the browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).\n",

You can declare variables using the keywords `var`, `let`, or `const`.\n\n### `var`\nThe `var` keyword was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped or globally-scoped.\n\n```javascript\nvar name = \"Alice\";\nvar age = 30;\n\nfunction sayHello() {\n  var message = \"Hello from the function\";\n  console.log(message); // \"Hello from the function\"\n}\n\n// console.log(message); // This would cause an error because message is function-scoped.\n```\n\n### `let`\nIntroduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), `let` provides block-scoping. A block is any code enclosed in curly braces `{}`, like in an `if` statement or a `for` loop. It's generally recommended to use `let` over `var`.\n\n```javascript\nlet count = 10;\nif (true) {\n  let count = 20; // This is a different 'count' variable\n  console.log(count); // 20\n}\nconsole.log(count); // 10\n```\n\n### `const`\nAlso introduced in ES6, `const` is used to declare constants. Like `let`, it is block-scoped. A `const` variable cannot be reassigned.\n\n```javascript\nconst PI = 3.14159;\n// PI = 3.14; // This would throw an error.\n\n// For objects and arrays, the reference is constant, but the contents can be changed.\nconst person = { name: \"Bob\" };\nperson.name = \"Charlie\"; // This is allowed.\n// person = { name: \"David\" }; // This would throw an error.\n```\n\n### Naming Variables\n- Variable names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.\n- Names must begin with a letter, `$`, or `_`.\n- Names are case-sensitive (`y` and `Y` are different variables).\n- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.\n",

Just place an `f` before the opening quote of your string, and then you can place any valid Python expression inside curly braces `{}`.\n\n```python\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 30\ngreeting = f\"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\"\nprint(greeting)\n# Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n```\n\n## Expressions Inside F-Strings\n\nYou can put any valid Python expression inside the braces, including function calls, arithmetic operations, and more.\n\n```python\n# Arithmetic operation\nprint(f\"Five plus ten is {5 + 10}.\")\n# Output: Five plus ten is 15.\n\n# Function call\ndef get_name():\n    return \"Bob\"\n\nprint(f\"His name is {get_name()}.\")\n# Output: His name is Bob.\n\n# Accessing dictionary values\nperson = {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 25}\nprint(f\"{person['name']} is {person['age']} years old.\")\n# Output: Charlie is 25 years old.\n```\n\n## Formatting Specifiers\n\nF-strings also support format specifiers, which follow a colon `:` inside the braces. This allows for fine-grained control over the output.\n\n### Formatting Numbers\nYou can control decimal precision, padding, and alignment.\n\n```python\npi = 3.14159265\n\n# Format to 2 decimal places\nprint(f\"The value of pi is approximately {pi:.2f}.\")\n# Output: The value of pi is approximately 3.14.\n\n# Add padding\nnumber = 42\nprint(f\"The number is {number:05}.\") # Pad with leading zeros to a width of 5\n# Output: The number is 00042.\n```\n\n### Formatting Dates\n\nYou can format `datetime` objects easily.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\ntoday = datetime.datetime.now()\n\nprint(f\"Today is {today:%Y-%m-%d}.\")\n# Output: Today is 2024-07-10.

    "description": "A practical guide to understanding and using decorators in Python.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\n## What are Decorators?\n\nIn Python, a decorator is a design pattern that allows you to add new functionality to an existing object (like a function or method) without modifying its structure. Decorators are a form of metaprogramming, where a part of the program tries to modify another part of the program at compile time. They are often used for logging, access control, instrumentation, and more.\n\n## Basic Decorator Syntax\n\nA decorator is typically a function that takes another function as an argument (the decorated function), adds some functionality, and then returns another function.\n\n```python\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello(name):\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\nsay_hello(\"World\")\n```\n\nThis will output:\n```\nSomething is happening before the function is called.\nHello, World!\nSomething is happening after the function is called.\n```\n\n## Using `functools.wraps`\n\nWhen you use decorators, you are essentially replacing the original function with the wrapper function. This can obscure the original function's metadata (like its name, docstring, etc.). The `functools.wraps` decorator can be used to preserve this metadata.\n\n```python\nimport functools\n\ndef my_better_decorator(func):\n    @functools.wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Wrapper executing pre-call actions.\")\n        value = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(\"Wrapper executing post-call actions.\")\n        return value\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_better_decorator\ndef greet(name):\n    \"\"\"Greets a person.\"\"\"\n    return f\"Greetings, {name}!\"\n\nprint(greet(\"Pythonista\"))\nprint(greet.__name__) # Output: greet (thanks to @functools.wraps)\nprint(greet.__doc__)  # Output: Greets a person. (thanks to @functools.wraps)\n```\n\nDecorators are a very useful tool in Python for writing cleaner and more modular code.\n",
      "html": "<h2>What are Decorators?</h2>\n<p>In Python, a decorator is a design pattern that allows you to add new functionality to an existing object (like a function or method) without modifying its structure. Decorators are a form of metaprogramming, where a part of the program tries to modify another part of the program at compile time. They are often used for logging, access control, instrumentation, and more.</p>\n<h2>Basic Decorator Syntax</h2>\n<p>A decorator is typically a function that takes another function as an argument (the decorated function), adds some functionality, and then returns another function.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello(name):\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\nsay_hello(\"World\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will output:</p>\n<pre><code>Something is happening before the function is called.\nHello, World!\nSomething is happening after the function is called.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Using <code>functools.wraps</code></h2>\n<p>When you use decorators, you are essentially replacing the original function with the wrapper function.

Python has no command for declaring a variable; a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.\n\n```python\nx = 5       # x is of type int\ny = \"Hello\" # y is of type str\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\n```\n\n### Naming Variables\n\n- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.\n- A variable name cannot start with a number.\n- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).\n\n## Data Types\n\nPython has various built-in data types. Here are some fundamental ones:\n\n- **Text Type**: `str`\n- **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float`, `complex`\n- **Sequence Types**: `list`, `tuple`, `range`\n- **Mapping Type**: `dict`\n- **Set Types**: `set`, `frozenset`\n- **Boolean Type**: `bool`\n- **Binary Types**: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`\n\n### Example of Data Types\n\n```python\nmy_string = \"Python is fun\"      # str\nmy_integer = 100                 # int\nmy_float = 3.14                  # float\nmy_list = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]    # list\nmy_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30} # dict\nmy_boolean = True                # bool\n\nprint(type(my_string))\nprint(type(my_integer))\nprint(type(my_float))\n```\n\nUnderstanding variables and data types is crucial for writing any Python program.\n",
