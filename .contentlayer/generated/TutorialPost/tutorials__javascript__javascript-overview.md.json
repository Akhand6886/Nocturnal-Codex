While it was initially created to make web pages interactive, it has since evolved into a versatile language used for both front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) development.\n\n### The \"Big Three\" of Web Development\n-   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Provides the basic structure and content of web pages. Think of it as the skeleton.\n-   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Used to control the presentation, formatting, and layout of the content. Think of it as the clothing and appearance.\n-   **JavaScript**: Used to control the behavior of the web page, creating dynamic and interactive experiences. Think of it as the brain and nervous system.\n\n### How JavaScript Works\nJavaScript code is embedded in or included from HTML pages and is executed by the JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. This client-side execution allows for immediate feedback and manipulation of the page content without needing to communicate with a server for every action.\n\n### Beyond the Browser: Node.js\nIn 2009, the creation of **Node.js** allowed JavaScript to be run outside of the browser, on servers. This opened the door for full-stack development using a single language, greatly expanding JavaScript's use cases to include:\n-   Building web servers and APIs.\n-   Creating command-line tools.\n-   Developing desktop applications.\n-   Powering IoT devices.\n\nJavaScript is an essential skill for any modern web developer and serves as the foundation for countless frameworks, libraries, and tools that power the web today.\n",
