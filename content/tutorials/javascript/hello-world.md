## Hello World in JavaScript

The "Hello, World!" program is a classic first step in learning any new programming language. It's a simple program that outputs `Hello, World!` to the screen.

### Using `console.log()`

The most common way to display output for debugging or learning purposes in JavaScript is using the `console.log()` method. This will print the output to the web console in your browser's developer tools.

```javascript
// This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

### Displaying in an Alert Box

You can also use the `alert()` function to display the message in a pop-up alert box in the browser.

```javascript
// This will create a pop-up with the message.
alert("Hello, World!");
```

### Writing Directly to the HTML Document

Another method, though less common for modern applications, is to write directly into the HTML document using `document.write()`.

```javascript
// This will write "Hello, World!" directly into the HTML body.
document.write("Hello, World!");
```

This is the foundational step to start your journey with JavaScript development.
