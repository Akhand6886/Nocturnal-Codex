## What is C#?

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language developed by Microsoft. Released in 2000 as part of the .NET Framework, C# is designed for building a wide variety of secure and robust applications that run on the .NET ecosystem.

### Key Features:
- **Object-Oriented**: C# is a pure object-oriented language, enforcing concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Type-Safe**: It prevents type errors that can occur at runtime, leading to more reliable applications. Variables are strongly typed.
- **Component-Oriented**: C# is designed for building reusable software components.
- **Part of .NET**: It is the primary language for the .NET framework, giving it access to a vast library of pre-written code and a powerful runtime environment.
- **Versatility**: Used for web applications (ASP.NET), game development (Unity), desktop applications (Windows Forms, WPF), and mobile apps (Xamarin, MAUI).

C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers. Its ongoing development has added many modern features like LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and async/await for asynchronous programming.
