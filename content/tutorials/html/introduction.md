## What is HTML?

The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It forms the very skeleton of web pages. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and scripting languages such as JavaScript for functionality.

### Core Concepts

- **Elements**: HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
- **Tags**: The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, a simple paragraph is enclosed in `<p>` tags: `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`.
- **Attributes**: Tags can also have attributes, which provide additional information about an element. For example, an `<img>` tag has a `src` attribute to specify the image source: `<img src="image.jpg">`.

### Basic Document Structure

A typical HTML document has the following structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares that this document is an HTML5 document.
- `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as its title.
- `<body>`: Contains the visible page content.

HTML is the foundational technology that every web developer must know.
