## What is C?

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. Developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, C was designed to be a system implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Mid-level Language**: C bridges the gap between low-level assembly language and high-level programming languages.
- **Structured Language**: It follows a structured approach, which makes the program easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Portability**: C programs can be compiled on different platforms with little to no modification.
- **Performance**: It produces efficient code that is fast to execute, making it suitable for system programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.
- **Foundation for Other Languages**: Many modern languages like C++, C#, Java, and Python have borrowed syntax and concepts from C.

By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and it has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. It remains one of the most influential programming languages ever created.
