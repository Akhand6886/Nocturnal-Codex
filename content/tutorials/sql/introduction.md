## What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

### What can SQL do?

- SQL can execute queries against a database
- SQL can retrieve data from a database
- SQL can insert records in a database
- SQL can update records in a database
- SQL can delete records from a database
- SQL can create new databases
- SQL can create new tables in a database
- SQL can create stored procedures in a database
- SQL can create views in a database
- SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

### Example Query

Here is an example of a simple SQL query to select all records from a "Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

To select only customers from a specific country, you could use a `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany';
```

SQL is an essential skill for data analysts, backend developers, and anyone involved in managing large-scale data. Different database systems have their own dialect of SQL (e.g., T-SQL for Microsoft SQL Server, PL/SQL for Oracle), but the core commands are largely standardized.
