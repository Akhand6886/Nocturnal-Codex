## Understanding Variables in Python

In Python, variables are used to store data values. Python has no command for declaring a variable; a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```python
x = 5       # x is of type int
y = "Hello" # y is of type str
print(x)
print(y)
```

### Naming Variables

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
- A variable name cannot start with a number.
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).

This tutorial covers Python variables in more detail.
