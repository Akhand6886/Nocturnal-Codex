## Iterating with Loops in Python

Loops are used in programming to repeat a specific block of code.

### For Loops

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
```

### While Loops

With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

This tutorial covers for and while loops.
