## What is VBA?

Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an implementation of Microsoft's event-driven programming language Visual Basic 6, which was discontinued in 2008, and its associated integrated development environment (IDE). VBA is built into most Microsoft Office applications and is used to automate repetitive tasks, create custom forms, and add new functionality.
