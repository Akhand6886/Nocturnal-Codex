## Welcome to the New Blog!

This post is a demonstration of how content can be managed using Decap CMS and stored as Markdown files in the `content/blog` directory.

You can write **bold text**, *italic text*, and even include:

```javascript
console.log('Hello from Markdown!');
```

More content will follow soon.
